### **_Getting Started_**

#### Upon loading the home page, either register yourself as a new user or use the guest login function to gain authorization to use all functions of the page. After logging into your account, browse through the 'Top Albums' page, select your genre of choice from the dropdown menu, or use the search bar to find your desired album. Once you have navigated to the 'album details' page, you can add this album to your list of favorites, view other users' reviews, or post your own review of the album. To view your list of favorite albums and reviews that you have posted, click on your username in the navigation bar. From this user details page, you can edit or delete any reviews that you have posted previously.
